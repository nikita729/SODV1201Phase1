        <h2>Our Aim</h2>

        <p>
          Coworking is a work style where different individuals or teams share a
          working environment. If you are a self-employed or a working-from-home
          professional, you would love to have the option to rent a meeting
          room, or a desk in an office equipped with high-speed internet,
          printers, copiers, stationaries, and office kitchen. As there is an
          increase in the number of coworkers and the number of sharable
          workspaces, we are looking to develop an application to connect both
          parties.
